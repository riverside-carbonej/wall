2. Navigate to **Firestore Database**
3. Click **Settings** → **Backup**
4. Enable **Automatic Backups** (recommended)

### Option 2: Manual Firebase Backup
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI if not already installed
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Create manual backup
firebase firestore:backup gs://riverside-wall-app-backups/manual-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

## 💾 Storage Backup Options

### Option 1: Download Your Local Backup
Your current backup is in: `./backups/2025-08-07T06-26-26-759Z/`

**Recommended:** Copy this entire folder to:
- External hard drive
- Cloud storage (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox)

- Multiple locations for safety

### Option 2: Firebase Storage Backup
Images are stored in Firebase Storage and automatically replicated by Google.

To manually backup images:

```
